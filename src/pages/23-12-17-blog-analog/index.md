firstParagraph: "Outside of development I experiment with photography as a creative outlet. I’ve recently been practicing analog photography, using black and white film to photograph cityscapes and people with my 1970 Minolta XD5 SLR. I’ve removed the digital process completely by processing and developing the film at home, converting a small bathroom into my temporary darkroom - currently researching how to create and 3D print a photo enlarger.
