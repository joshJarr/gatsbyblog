firstParagraph: "A subject close to my heart, I’ve been an advocate of DIY IoT after investigating this during my degree, and gave a short talk on the subject. This post will cover how I have created my own IoT devices that mimic or improve on the consumer products for (usually) much cheaper. I’ll talk about the processing I go through when prototyping and implementing embedded devices around my home."
