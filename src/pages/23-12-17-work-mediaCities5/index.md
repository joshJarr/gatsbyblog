The MediaCities5 conference was hosted at Plymouth University in 2015 reflecting on the social smart city. I was working in a small team on a project chosen to be exhibited in the conference.

Crime Walk was a web and mobile installation that consumed public crime data to reflect hotspots of crime around the city. The mobile app produced with PhoneGap grabbed the users GPS position and played sounds related to the crime amount and type at their location. Users could explore the city while real time location data streamed a orchestra of criminal activity, each instrument relating to the type of crime.

For the installation we adapted the app into a website, hosting the site and presenting it in the exhibition with a touch screen monitor in kiosk mode with a projector, allowing users to interact with and explore the city. Here we used the Google Map API to display the city in a interactive way.
